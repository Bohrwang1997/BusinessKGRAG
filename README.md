#Project 6: Business Definitions for Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG RAG)

##Overview

This project, in collaboration with Navitas, aims to enhance the management of business definitions in a data catalog through the integration of Knowledge Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG RAG). I am analyzing 214 business definitions covering areas such as data, business rules, and reporting measures. The goal is to assess the effectiveness of KG RAG in retrieving and generating accurate business definitions, using T5-small as the language model. The solution is designed to improve the accessibility and accuracy of business definitions within data catalogs, moving beyond traditional spreadsheet-based systems.

##Key Features

- Automated Retrieval and Generation: Automating the retrieval of business definitions with KG RAG to reduce manual work and errors.
- Enhanced Accuracy: KG RAG improves reliability by utilizing structured knowledge graphs and reducing hallucinations.
- T5-small Model Integration: The T5-small model offers a lightweight but effective solution for generating business definitions.
- Scalability: This solution is scalable to support the growing number of business definitions within the catalog.

##Project Objectives

1. Evaluate KG RAG Applicability: Analyze the strengths and limitations of KG RAG for managing business definitions.
2. Propose a Combined Solution: Develop a hybrid solution integrating KG RAG with T5-small.
3. Implementation and Testing: Create a detailed implementation plan, followed by testing to ensure improved accessibility and accuracy.

##Deliverables

- RAG and KG RAG Models: Implement and fine-tune models using T5-small for business definitions management.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Insights into the data trends and patterns.
- Comprehensive Report: Detailed methodology, results, and future recommendations.
- Presentation: A summary of the project presented for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- Supporting Code and Notebooks: The final deliverables will include all relevant code and Jupyter notebooks.

##Timeline

- Week 5: Project proposal approval
- Week 6: Exploratory data analysis and initial data discussions
- Week 7-8: Preliminary results for RAG and KG RAG models
- Week 11: Final project report and presentation
- Week 12: Finalized models and code handover

##Methods

###Domain Understanding
I will ensure close collaboration with Navitas to fully understand the existing business processes and limitations, enabling the design of a well-informed solution.

###Technical Approach
The models will be built using T5-small, with iterative improvements through feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and validation using cross-validation techniques.

- Exploratory Data Analysis: Key insights into data size, distribution, and relationships will be explored.
- Prototyping: The RAG and KG RAG models will be built iteratively, ensuring performance improvements.
- Client Collaboration: Regular updates and feedback sessions with Navitas will guide the project.
